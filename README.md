## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

**File:** `task1.py`

**Functionality:**
- Prompts the user to enter two numerical values.
- Performs the following mathematical operations on the entered numbers:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Includes a safety check to avoid division by zero.
- Displays the result of each operation clearly on the screen.

This program helps in understanding numerical data handling and basic arithmetic in Python.

## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

**File:** `task2.py`

**Functionality:**
- Prompts the user to enter their first name and last name.
- Combines (concatenates) the first and last names to form a full name.
